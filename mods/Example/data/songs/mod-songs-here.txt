Check this same folder on the assets folder in case of curiosity regardling which files can be overridden

Songs require a special file called "freeplay.json" in order to be added to the Freeplay Menu without attaching said song to a week
the contents of said file goes as follows:

{
	"name": "SONG NAME",
	"opponent": "character name",
	"color": "#HEXCODE"
}

as for the folder structure, it goes as follows:

song	>
	| Inst.ogg (REQUIRED)
	| Voices.ogg (OPTIONAL)
	| song-difficulty.json (e.g: test-hard.json)
	| song.json (fallback chart for this song, not necessarily required but always good to have)
